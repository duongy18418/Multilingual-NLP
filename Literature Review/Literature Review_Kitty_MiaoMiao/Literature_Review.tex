\begin{abstract}
  Besides English, Chinese is listed as one of the most spoken languages in the world, with 21 countries considering it to be the mother tongue by part of their population. Due to its popularity, Chinese also has many varieties across multiple countries and regions. When an algorithm is developed for translation and multilingual usage, the developers will sometimes choose only one specific variant of Chinese to implement. However, given the growing popularity of global marketing strategy, companies need to adjust their marketing material multiple times when entering new markets, even though some of these markets use Chinese. Given the needs, we propose conducting a research project for a new algorithm using Natural Language Processing to make translating and adjusting marketing materials to multiple variants of Chinese more efficient.
